# lazyspaces

Lazyspaces allow you to create extremely quickly a workspace for your experiments using various presets you can create.\
For example you can create a new workspace for FL Studio project or a new workspace with empty python file that will be automatically opened in your IDE.\
The possibilities are endless!\
After all of that you can just remove the workspace or move it to target directory to keep things organized.\
No more manual setup for your silly and quick experiments!
